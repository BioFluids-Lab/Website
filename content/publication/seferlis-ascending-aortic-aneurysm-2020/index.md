abstract: "The present thesis aims at studying the normal and hypertensive stress state of the ascending thoracic  aortic aneurysm (aTAA) during cardiac systole. Primarily, data and geometric features were collected from the international literature and after  processing and adapting them to the needs of this thesis, we proceeded to design the aortic models. The  designed geometries are idealized models of the human aorta. After a literature study, it was found that the size of the vessels is proportionally related to the  dimensions of the person, and that it is common to define Body Surface Area (m2 ) (BSA) as an indicator  for quantifying the size of the human body. For this reason, four characteristic BSA values were selected in such a way as to cover the full range of  human body sizes, and then four models of the physiological aorta were constructed, each  corresponding to one of these values. The next step was to design the pathological geometries, i.e. the aneurysmal models. A key feature in  characterizing an aneurysm is its maximum diameter. Conclusively, an important condition for  conducting a comprehensive study is the comparison of aneurysms of different sizes. For this reason,  the original, physiological geometries were modified and for each of them, approximately six different  aneurysmal (aTAA) models were designed. The pathological, aortic models, therefore, were  parameterized according to the aneurysm diameter. At the same time, computed tomography data were obtained from a patient suffering from an  ascending aortic aneurysm. The processing and synthesis of this data was performed in the commercial  package MIMICS where the reconstruction of the real aneurysmal vessel was achieved. Thus, it became  possible to study the idealized models in comparison with a real pathological geometry. This study was performed using the Finite Element Method (FEM) in ANSYS R19.0 software. Initially, we  imported the geometries in the program and after setting the necessary boundary conditions we  proceeded to load the aortic lumen with normal (120mmHg) and hypertensive (240 mmHg) systolic  pressure. The simulation for the patient model was performed in the FEBio package under the exactsame  conditions. Similarly, the choice of elastic properties was the same in both assuming an elastic and  isotropic material. Upon completion of the simulations, stress ($σ$) – strain ($ε$) results were extracted and visualized using  snapshots and diagrams as a function of the diameter of the aneurysmal tissue. It is also worth noting  that Chapter 3. Results shows the results for a single idealized model that better approximates the  reconstructed geometry, so that we are able to compare them and draw a safe conclusion. Finally, photos of the results for all models are presented in the Appendix along with some additional  diagrams of deformation and average stress with respect to aTAA diameter."
